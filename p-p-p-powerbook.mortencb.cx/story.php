<span style="font-size : 24px;">The PowerBook</span>

<p>It all started with an eBay auction for a new G4 Powerbook. My friend Cory wanted me to sell it for him just days after he bought it. Probably because he realized, aside from looking cool, he had no real use for it. For the sake of an easy sale, I just pretended to sell it as my own, with a starting price of $1700, and the buy it now option for $2100.</p>

 

<i><p>You are bidding on my 19 day old G4 Powerbook. This was purchased for a project that fell through. When I tried to return it, I was informed of a 10 day limit for returns!</p>

<p>Your new laptop comes with its original box, all of its documentation, all of its original accessories, and the blue tooth mouse.</p>

<p>Laptop Details: (Screen size, RAM, HD Space, blah blah blah) Free Shipping yadda yadda yadda</p></i>

 

<p>Days went by with no sign of interest, when I receive this email from an interested eBay member . . .</p>

 

<i><p>Hello I am very interested in your unit. I would like to know your best price to buy it now and if you ship international. I am in London UK right now. I would also want to know the condition of the unit. Please let me know I am very interested. Thank you in advance </p>

<p>To view the item, go to: <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/ebayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=4125873654" target="_blank">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/ebayISAPI.dl...item=4125873654</a></p></i>



<p><i>Thank you,<br>
msalamon</i></p>

 

 

<p>Ok, I went over all of this in the auction. Assuming he doesn't know how to read, I respond.</p>

 

<i><p>Well, I will ship it to you in London, but I will not do it for free. I'm sorry, but that is too much out of my own pocket. Please give me you address and I will go get a price for the shipping to London.</p>

<p>As for the condition, it is pristine.  I've only had it for 21 days now, only being used at my office. (although I've stopped using it now) If you would like, I can take more close up, high resolution pictures. 
The buy it now price is $2,100 (US currency)  + the shipping to London. </p>

<p>Please let me know if you are interested!</p>

 

<p>Thank you!<br>

Jeff</p></i>

 

 

<p>Seems like a smooth sale so far, right? </p>

<p>Then I get this:</p>

<p><i>Hello,<br>
I'm very very interested for this item and I'm ready to pay you the best price $2100+ overnight or 2 days shipping charges (UPS DHL FEDEX OR FEDEX OR PARCEL FORCE) if we will use an escrow service to handle this transaction.As for the escrow service , I am already registered with www.set-ltd.net  and my uzername is the same with my email address.I will pay the express shipping  and also , the escrow fee . The escrow service will release you the money as soon as I will let them know that the item passed the inspection and is 100% ok.</p>
<p>  The escrow fee is on my charge , don't worry .Please let me know if my offer is good enough for you . If it does , I will initiate the transaction with the escrow service as soon as I will have your confirmation.If is ok please register in order to make the deal and start the payment procedures.Hope that everything will be ok and close the deal in the best conditions.</p>
     <p>Kind regards !</p></i>

 

<p>Ok. I watch King 5 news. I've seen this on CNN. Welcome to your textbook eBay scam. At first, I was just going to reply with a 72pt font FUCK OFF, or perhaps a disgusting picture, but I decided to see what the upstanding members of the forums thought. And of course, right away, it is all picked apart. . .</p>

 

<p>Almost right away, <b>Grom</b> posted this:</p>

<p><i>Hmmm that escrow service doesn't look very legit - check the verisign secureid link, it's just a javascript pop-up which pretends to be going to verisign's site. The actual page it displays is just <a href="http://www.set-ltd.net/VeriSign.php" target="_blank">http://www.set-ltd.net/VeriSign.php</a> - or have I got the wrong end of the stick?</i></p>

<p><i>It looks hopelessly unprofessional and doesn't seem right anyway - ask him if he will use a different escrow service. That one is either fraudulent or just plain shit. </i></p>

 

<p>After <b>Starbucks</b> discovers that the site is registered to:</p>

<p><i>Domain Name.......... set-ltd.net<br>
Creation Date........ 2004-04-16<br>
Registration Date.... 2004-04-16<br>
Expiry Date.......... 2005-04-16<br>

Organisation Address. 851 Foxcrest Court # A<br>
Organisation Address.<br>
Organisation Address. Terre Haute<br>
Organisation Address. 47803<br>
Organisation Address. IN<br>
Organisation Address. UNITED STATES</i></p>

<p>Almost right away <b>P-niiice</b> discovers Saral is a college professor!</p>

<i><p>Could it be this Saral Surakul?<br>
<a href="http://www.indstate.edu/fcs/facprof_surakul.html" target="_blank">http://www.indstate.edu/fcs/facprof_surakul.html</a><br>
Indiana State university is in Terra Haute.</p></i>

 

<p>Of course we all dig up a bunch of this information on this guy, and his office contact information. I draft an email to send him with all of the info we dug up, when we get a better idea. Why don't we string him along? Lets see how far I can take it. . .</p>

 

<i><p>Well that sounds ok to me! I was able to log onto your internet web site. (Which I must say looks very nice to me!)
I just had a few questions. . .</p>
<p>What should I use for a user name and password? I like to use the same thing for everything. Ebay, paypal, email. . . is that ok?
In your FAQ, I noticed that you can use the set-ltd.net services, and it does not have to be an "online" purchase. But if its not online, how do they get to your website?</p>

<p>Thank you!
Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>While we wait for our response, I post his email address and we go to town on his eBay account. Almost everything is in German, and the feedback isn't that bad. Translators come in to help with some of his feedback entries, but pretty much prove useless.</p>

 

<p>Our next email is pretty short and sweet:</p>

 

<p><i>Please retry to enter <a href="http://www.set-ltd.net" target="_blank">www.set-ltd.net</a> and let me know your user name there.OK.
Thank you.</i></p>

 

<p>So, I register on the site, and let him know.</p>

<i><p>Hello!</p>

<p>I have just finished creating my account on the escrow site that you suggested. My escrow username is MyNameIsJeffHarris. 
Before we continue, I wanted to ask; do you know if this site had a strong digital defense? 
I read that escrow services who do not utilize a strong digital defense can often be attacked, and the buyer and or seller can lose money or their item. I really don't want this to happen! I'm sure you don't either!</p>

<p>I don't mean to ask so many questions; as you can see, I am new at ebay. By doing it this way, will I get to skip the extra ebay fees? That would be really great. I don't want to pay them extra money.
What is the next step? I have never really used escrow. </p>

<p>Thank you!<br>
Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>Here is where our friend gets excited. . .</p>

First of all I want ot tell you that you will not pay anything because I pay the escrow, UPS and other fees. Ok? I started the transaction with the nr. 6813088950 . Now please enter www.set-ltd.net , acces your account with the uzername that you have and if the transaction isOk with you please accept it. Ok? Once you do that I will send the funds =2100$ plus shipping $180. Ok? Please send the unit express UPS or Fedex.I will send them money and they will let you know as soon as they get the amount. Then you can send the unit at my address. Ok? Do not worry I know a lot of people that used this service and it is OK. Please let me know. THANKS</p></i>

 

<p>At this time I posted my username and password for our new escrow site. While browsing the site under my new account, it turned out I had some other pending sales and purchases. . .</p>

<p>After encouraging everyone to create more transfers, I sent this:</p>

 

<i><p>Hello sir!<br>
Please let me thank you again for being so patient with me! It is too bad we are settling outside of ebay, because I was going to leave you "EXCELENT EBAYER!!!!!11 A++++++++== WOULD SELL TO ANYTIME" I guess it is ok though becaue I would have to give them an extra $300 when the auction was over.</p>

<p>I logged onto your preferred escrow site and saw our transaction. I did not see any place to accept it though! Did I just not see it? Sorry I am new at this. Where do I go to say OK? </p>

<p>Where on the site does it say where to ship it to! I am very eager to get this thing shipped so I can hurry up and start the process to get my money! Once I ok our transaction does it tell me where to ship the laptop? I am very positive you will be satisfied with the laptop.</p>

<p>One other thing, You seemed to confident about this escrow service, that I think I am going to use it myself for my other transactions. Is that ok? I will be buying and selling other laptops and would like the security. I will be buying many things and will need a escrow service with a strong digital defense to send my money to so I don't get ripped off.</p>

<p>Thanks again!<br>

<p>A lot of these were listed, and pretty funny, but we decided to stop with them, because we didn't want our little scammer to grow wise.</p>

 

 

 

<p>While waiting for his response, I decided, that because it was my original sale, I would report the account to eBay. I went through all the hoops, filled out all the forms. To sum it up, I let them know what we discovered, and asked them to take some action. This is what I get:</p>

 

<i><p>Hello,</p>

<p>Thank you for writing to eBay's Customer Support with your concerns. My name is John and I appreciate the chance to answer your question. I'm happy to assist you further.</p>

<p>An Escrow service allows the buyer to send their money to the Escrow Company, and the Seller then ships the item to the Buyer. Once the Buyer approves the item the Escrow service then pays the Seller. eBay recommends escrow for transactions over $500.00.</p>

<p>The Escrow service affiliated with eBay is called Escrow.com. eBay encourages members to take advantage of the assurance that escrow services can provide. For more information on escrow, please see the following eBay page:</p>

<p><a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/escrow.html" target="_blank">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/escrow.html</a></p>

<p>I wish you the best with your future transactions.</p>

<p>Regards, </p>

<p>John W. S.<br>
eBay Customer Support</p></i>


<p>WELL THANK YOU JOHN! MY CUP RUNETH OVER! Let's see. . . someone is reporting an obvious scam and fake escrow site. Obviously he has no idea what escrow is. BETTER SCHOOL HIM!</p>

 

<p>This just plain pissed me off. Can this be their response to other reports of scams? </p>

<p>Perhaps this email was a little too angry:</p>

 

<i><p>Hi John,</p>

<p>Not to be rude, but I know quite well what escrow is. I also happen to know that this is an obvious scam attempt. Had you actually read the form I filled out on your site, and not replied with the canned response: Escrow 101, you would notice that I did not ask what escrow was. I was reporting someone wants to settle the sale outside of ebay, through an escrow site he referred me to. A site that claims to be a VeriSign secure site, but then you click the logo, he is hosting the VeriSign page -the page that should take you to the verisign site. This is a text book rip off.</p>
<p>This can't be your answer to everyone who reports these types of things can it? I really think you should take some action against this person. </p>

<p>Please email me when you will send the package and give me the tracking number.

<p>And now we have his address.  (I'm not going to insert the screen shots) Everyone had a lot of ideas on how to mess with this guy. </p>

<p><b>lushka16</b> had a great idea:</p>

<i><p>Holy shit!! The next course of action is WICKED obvious, he even said it himself:</p> </i>

<p class="quote">quote:</p> 


<hr>


Here the duty taxes are 27,5% from the total amount wrote on the package <br>


<hr>

<p><i>Put like $8000 on the package and make the fucker pay $2200 for it.</i></p>

 

 

<p>This was perfect! Obviously, $8000, was high, but marking it $2200 and having him pay the 27%  is genious!</p>

<p>I wanted to send him something, but couldn't think of anything. It had to be something worth paying for, and worth the effort. But what?</p>

 

<p><b>EricFate</b> got my imagination going:</p>

<i><p>Send a three ring binder with a hand drawn keyboard taped to the inside of the bottom flap, and a hand drawn screen taped to the inside of the top flap.</p>

<p>Crayon preferred.</p> </i>

 

<p>YES. This was perfect! Trick the scammer into paying a few hundred dollars for a fake laptop! Genius! But I wanted to take it a step further. While I thought about it, I sent another email, and posted my plan. . .</p>

 

<i><p>Hello!<br>
Well, it looks like I am ready to ship! I got my email from the escrow site too. I also have your email with your address so I will be sending your laptop today or the next day. </p>

<p>I told my friend about you and she said that she would like to sell you more if you are interested! Would you like to buy more of the ultra powerful G4 powerbooks? She has them at her work to sell because people only know how to use them for AOL Instant Messenger and flash versions of Asteroid. So please respond as soon as you can. I would like to tell her that you would like to purchase more laptops. You seem pretty cool and trust worthy. So let me know fast. If you want more, send the money to the escrow and let me know. Once I get the email and know that everything is set up I will then send them all at the same time. I save money on shipping this way!</p>

<p>Thanks again for all your help with this sale. I only wish I could leave you feedback on ebay because I wanted to leave EXCELENT SELLAR A+++ W@W LQQK OMGBBQ or something like that. I think feedback is so cool! I like to come up with new and exciting ways to leave it!</p>

<p>I was thinking. Since you basically helped me save $250 from ebay fees, I wanted to share some of that with you. So go ahead and tell the Digitally Defended Escrow site that I want to refund you $100 for helping me. They can do that right? That is my gift to you.</p>

<p>I eagerly await your response!!!!!</p>

<p>Jeff<br></i>
(Even if he says he wants more and has sent the money for them all I will say I am sending the one first. Then the others.)</p>

<p>Yes. I want to mail him something.
<b>1.</b> I don't really have any laptop to smash up. So I will construct one. Crayons - 3 ring binder - glitter - failed cd burns which I will label as various programs - I will glue keys from broken keyboard. (or should I just draw them?) </p>

<p><b>2.</b> A print out of this thread Will be included (sans anything linking to SA)</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Gross pictures</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The package will be valued at $2100 and will weight the same as a real G4.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> Pencil Shavings</p>

<p>I will consruct this all as fast as I can. I think I can get it all done today. Yes, I will post pictures! But there is one thing: This will cost me money to send London. So I propose, after I complete this notebook, I will get the exact ammount of shipping. Would any of you be willing to help pay for the shipping? I would post the tracking number of corse. Just a thought.</p> 

<p>(Its getting shipped - help from anyone or not so stay tuned)</p>

 

 

 

 

<p>Then it was born . . </p>.

Thank you for writing with your concern over the member, msalamon.</p>

<p>The recent bids placed with this account were the result of an 
unauthorized account takeover. Unfortunately, we were not aware of this 
activity until some time after the bids were placed. Once we became 
aware of this activity, immediate action was taken. We are now in the 
process of restoring the account to its owner.</p>
<p>I have reported the escrow site to the appropriate department to have it looked at. 
Since the account holder did not initiate this sale, you may consider 
the transaction null and void if you have not already shipped the item.</p>

<p>Let me also suggest a few ways this takeover could have occurred.</p>

<p>If the user had a relatively simple password or password hint question 
it is possible that a third party was able to gain access to the account by guessing the password.</p> 

<p>It is also possible that the user could have unknowingly provided his or her password to another party. Some eBay members have reported receiving messages asking for User IDs and passwords. These messages appear to 
come from eBay Support, but in fact are not. eBay will never ask for 
sensitive information of this nature through email.</p> 

<p>Finally, there are a number of computer viruses in circulation that log 
and record keystrokes. It's recommended that computer users keep their 
virus alert software up-to-date, and check their system often for 
problems. A firewall for high-speed Internet users is also highly 
recommended.</p>

<p>**I have reviewed your email history and see that the email from 
<msalamon> was in regards to item # 4125873654. After reviewing this 
listing, I see that you did end up with a winning bidder, zoeviolet01.</p>

<p>We are concerned about violations on the site and have taken the liberty of investigating this member's account. Please be assured that we have 
taken appropriate action in accordance with our site policies. Such 
action may include issuing a warning, a temporary suspension, an 
indefinite suspension or terminating the membership. </p>

<p>As you may know, we are unable to provide specific information regarding the result of our investigation to third party members. Please 
understand that this is for the protection of all eBay users. However, 
we can tell you that our records indicate that the user you are 
reporting is currently not a registered eBay user. </p>

<p>Since the buyer is no longer registered on the eBay site, you may 
consider the transaction null and void. You can submit a Final Value Fee credit request by following the instructions below:</p>


<p>I appreciate your interest in the well being of our site. It is assuring to know that we have members who are concerned about the safety of our 
other users. I encourage you to continue to report all questionable 
behavior to eBay. This will give us the chance to look into the 
situation and take action where warranted.</p>

community.</p>

<p>Well, that explains the mystery of the strange German account! Just add the hacked account to the list of evidence.</p>

 

<p>Deviating from him usual email schedule, our scammer responds:</p>

<p>The donations came flooding in. Shortly after this post, I went home from work, to find my power was off. After a couple hours in the dark, I logged on to find just over $100 in donations! I couldn't believe it! Thanks to all of you who donated.</p>

 

<p>It wasn't long before I received another email from our scammer, who was growing more and more inpatient.</p>

<p>Someone is getting a little pushy! I replied with this:</p>

 

<i><p>Hello! I am sorry for the delay! I was not able to send your new G4 Powerbook to you yesterday! But I am able to send it today! I am going to be taking it down the the united states post office to fedex it to you. I am told it will take 2-3 days. I apologize, but that is the fastest I can send!</p>

<p>I will send another email with your tracking number when I get back!!!</p>

<p>chao!<br>
Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>Off to the post office I went. I have to admit . . . this is where I started to get very nervous. Will he look me up through the return address? Will customs come bring the smack down for the over-pricing? What if? What if? What if?</p>

 

<p>I managed to choke it down, and go send it</p>

<p>When I was in the store, I'm sure I looked very nervous. I could feel my face turn red and my body temperature rise. As I was filling out the form, the lady asked me what the value of the package was. . . .</p>

<p>"Um, $2000 will do." (I was trying to hold it, but I was smiling from ear to ear.</p>

<p>She looked at me with a confused look.</p> 

<p>"You know they will have to pay a lot for tax on customs."</p>

<p>(My smile grew even bigger.) </p>

<p>"I know."</p>

 

<p>Road Block: It turns out, when you send something to London from the US through FedEx, they want a phone number. No big deal., I said I would go email him, and call them to ship it off.</p>

<i><p>Hello,<br>
I took the package to the post office, but FedEx requires a phone number for the recipient if the package is being sent internationally.
As soon as you reply with that I will call them and tell them so they can send it.</p>


<p>Thanks!<br>
Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>I began to wonder at this point . . . Obviously, this guy wasn't going to give me a legitimate number.  I got my receipt and they told me it would send after I called with his phone number. </p>

<p><img src="the_powerbook_files/image023.jpg" border="1"></p>


<p>Taken from the post with the receipt:</p>

<p><i>For those of you who can make it out, the tracking number is 846563452310 (there is a package ID too, I don't know if you need it: 17913) Again, It's not going anywhere until I get a phone number. 
It took way to long to find an angle where that shit all showed up!</i></p>

 

<p>In the mean time, a member named Pipski makes history. Pipski becomes our first undercover agent in London, and makes the first recon mission into the scammers address.</p>

Going to take a quick tour of the street and see if I can see any other entrances to flat 9B. Will post again in a few hours when I get home.

<i><p>OK no problem, this is my phone number 00447940667511.Please email me soon.Please send the package gift or small value and send EXPRESS SHIPPING</p>.

<p> Regards</p></i>

 

<p>I immediately called and had it sent. Once I posted the number, I think everyone on the site called. And of course, it was a false number. Just in case, I later removed it from the post, in case he somehow noticed the hundreds of calls. We didn't want to scare him off now do we?</p>

 

<p>Once I had his number, I sent him his tracking number.</p>

 

<i><p>Here is your tracking number. 846563452310. The package ID is 17913. The lady at the post office said that FedEx comes at 4:00pm to take shipments. So in about 2 hours it will be scanned in the fedex thing I guess and you can start tracking it. I shipped it express, so it should be there in 2 to 3 days.</p>

<p>Also, the post office lady asked what it was, and I didn't want to lie, so I said laptop computer. When she said how much it is worth, I said, it is a family gift, but she said I couldn't do that. She said I had to tell her how much I paid for it. I don't want to get in trouble for mail fraud, or evading taxes or anything so I told her $2000. I am sorry if that means you have to pay more. Since I screwed up, I will share the cost with you. Please let me know how much it was, and just have the escrow service refund you half of the amount. Can they do that? If not I will gladly send you how ever much you spent on it. You can even have the escrow hold my payment until I send you money for what you pay.</p>
<p>I hope this doesn't make you want to cancel. As I'm sure you noticed, no one ever bid on it and it didn't sell. I really need the money, so I am willing to work with you how ever to complete the transaction.</p>

<p>Thank you my friend!<br>

Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>As soon as Pipski got back from the drop site. He posted the details of his findings. This gave us all a really good idea of the shop.</p>

		<td class="textB" width="600"><p>OK, I have good news and bad news. btw, thanks for all the concern but 1st thing I did when I got in was alter my p/w. I figured it was worth running the risk, but I guarantee you this is me, not the scambarber.</p>

<p>The bad news is about the photos. Just had a quick butchers at them - lousy cheapo cam doesn't have a screen - and they ain't so hot. In my defence, it is damned difficult to take snaps from underneath a barber's gown or a computer desk. Also, this cam is a horrible piece of crud with no image-stabilizing or anything. I'll autobalance them in PS and then sort out hosting for the very few that are even worth the effort.</p>

<p>On the plus side I picked up a fair but of HUMINT. For a start, the street map is misleading. The entrance to the shop is actually on the Edgeware Rd. The address given is a grotty little non-street that the properties back onto. Do we care? Well, I dunno if FedEx or UPS or whoever we're going with use GPS, but if the two streets have different postcodes and the driver just follows his GPS he might go straight to the back entrance, so that would bear watching. That said, I still think he'd end up out front because the back of the properties are totally anonymous afai could see, he would have no way of knowing which one was which. Plus there's high walls and bins and it's all very unprepossessing.</p>

<p>OK, so, the shop itself. Two barber chairs, four or five very cramped terminals downstairs and, I think, some upstairs too. Big window, easy visibility inside from without. Under the window (on the outside) is a mailbox for '9B' but there is no way on Earth our man is going to get a laptop-sized package in it. Were I the delivery guy I would take one look at that and then go into the shop and ask. Oh, the shop also sells toy guns for some inadequately explored reason.</p>

<p>The owner, or at least the guy in charge while I was there, is a black guy in his mid-20s (estimate). Credit where it's due, the haircut he gave me was of a pretty good standard (not a bad barnet, for Barnet). Not the sharpest knife in the box and he has some odd ideas relating to the police. </p>

<p>[They have a TV there and while I was being barbered the news story came on about a nurse here in the UK, who's been arrested - or tried, i forget which - for murdering four of her patients. Whereupon my man expressed incredulity that they could possibly know that and went on to say that he thought Harold Shipman probably only actually killed 'one or two' people and that a serial rapist of the elderly currently plagueing London, who has been confirmed as of Caribbean descent by DNA tests, probably 'only' actually raped one person. Although that, he tells me, 'is bad enough'.]</p>

<p>I am a notoriously bad judge of character but I have my doubts that this is our man. He doesn't strike me as a scammer, for all his other faults. That isn't to say that I couldn't well imagine him taking a cut (no pun intended), but I don't think he's the real culprit.</p>

<p>No-one else turned up there for a haircut. When I arrived (and when I left) a big black guy (who looks just like the cook who has a heart attack in Crimson Tide) was listening to banging choons on one of the PCs and a pasty, ginger sort was on one of the others. While I was there a rather skanky looking Kappa-slapper came down from upstairs - she was clearly a regular btw, a bunch of schoolkids arrived and went straight upstairs - also well known to the owner. In fact, now I come to think about it, everyone there but me seemed to be a regular. Oh, and a dude in a red t-shirt (photo'd - badly) also came d'stairs and left the place.</p> 

<p>The street itself is - well, it's the Edgeware Rd. Rub-a-tug shops, takeaways, pool halls, minicab firms and dodgy boozers. There is a Wetherspoons pub right next door to the shop. That could be handy if - on the day of arrival, and assuming the package didn't arrive before opening time - we could occupy seats by the window with a good view. Waiting in the warm with a beer sounds infinitely preferable to shuffling about on the pavement in the pissing rain. Not sure about local parking restrictions but it ought to be possible to park up in a position with a good view of the entrance too, at reasonable times of day. </p>

<p>The scenario that presents itself as plausible - although it is arguably pointless to try and predict these things - is that UPS man (or whomever) will end up going into the barbernet cafe, with his delivery. If I was our scamboy, I would make a point of heading for the place - assuming I didn't own it - when tracking suggests delivery is imminent. That would be ideal for our purposes because a goon watching the front, one watching the back and one inside, all with mobile 'phones, could pretty much sow that location up. Apart from a parked car or the pub there are no real vantage points sadly. Of course, what would be ideal for any 'capture-the-moment-when-the-long-arm-of-SA-reaches-out-&-touches-someone' exploits would be a couple of yuppie-goons with Wifi laptops and webcams.</p>

<p>That's me breathing into a bag hoping I don't pass out. Or have my heart explode.  With our operatives already on the way, we had to just hope that it changed fast, and got delivered while they were there.</p>

<p>Basically, everyone in the thread went fucking ballistic. We had all thought that FedEx had sent it out for delivery, and just didn't update the site. After we thought it arrived, our men left. Before Starbucks left, he set the screen savers on the computers upstairs to scroll: "P-P-P-POWERBOOK!" </p>

<p>It was not long before the webcam feed was posted. (Available on the site.) Even more pics of the outside of the building were posted. Een one with a clear shot of the REAL number for the shop.</p>

<p>As I was unsure, and grew impatient, another email was sent. </p>


<i><p>Hello!</p>

<p>Today is the 3rd day so you should be getting your new laptop!</p>

<p>I saw on the FedEx site and it is delayed! Does that mean it is still waiting to be delivered? I don't know what time it is there, but I hope it gets there today. Or did you get it and FedEx just didn't update their web page? Sorry, I don't send things with FedEx often. I usually just use first class us mail. </p>

<p>Did you pay for the taxes? How much did you end up paying? I am sorry again for that. I didn't mean to cost you extra money. But like I said in my other email, we can work it out.</p>

<p>How long will the ok' process take? I am eager to receive payment! </p>

<p>Thank you!<br>
Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>The thread grew very fast with posts of everyone's excitement and praise of it finally being delivered . . . but as it turns out . . . it had not been delivered.</p>

<p>Thanks for doing that . . . my dear wife. </p>

 

<p>So it came down to, FedEx could not deliver it, because they number they are trying to call him on is fake. They can't have him pay the taxes if they can't find him right?</p>

 

<p>At this point, we sat, and so began, the many days of Regulatory Agency Clearance Delay. For about 7 days, right about the same time in the morning, the FedEx tracking page was updated with Regulatory Agency Clearance Delay.</p>

<p>With no emails from the scammer, we thought it was over. Our ringer was to sit in the purgatory of FedEx customs for ever. </p>

 

<p>Sometime around this point my title was even changed to Regulatory Agency Clearance Delay.</p>

<p>I told the woman at FedEX that I would confer with you and have you contact them. </p>

<i><p>Hello!<br>
I received a call from FedEx saying that they are unable to get a hold of you to deliver the package. I really need payment for my laptop, so the sooner you get it and approve of it, the sooner the escrow can release my money to me. They said that they will have to charge me to hold it if they cannot deliver it. If that is the case, I will just pay to have it sent back.</p>

<p>Do you have another phone number? I was going to try to look you up by address maybe, but I don't think that will work, so I thought I'd ask you first! Please respond as soon as you can! I am very eager to complete the transaction!</p>

<p>Thank you!<br>

<i><p>Hello friend!</p>

<p>It sure took a long time, but it got there! I was worried for a while! I thought I had lost my powerbook for good in some kind of scam. 
I wish I didn't pay for such fast shipping, now that I see how long FedEx takes. Please let me know when you are done checking everything and making sure it works. I packed it pretty well. I hope shipping didn't bang it up. You will see I included some extra books. I didn't really need them now that I got rid of the powerbook.</p>

<p>Anyways, I still cannot log onto the escrow site. Will payment still be sent even though they are having connection problems? I realized I never gave my address or any bank account information for payment. If I were to give that to you, would you be able to get it to them so they can send the payment? That would be great. I need this money to pay my rent. </p>

<p>I am curious . . . What did you end up paying for the taxes? I wanted to know because I still want to refund some of the money to you.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
Jeff</p></i>

 

<p>And this is where we sit. We know he paid for it, and we know he has it. Now we wait for his response. If none is received, then we call and find out why.</p>
